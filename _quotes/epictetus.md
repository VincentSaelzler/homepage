> We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak

**Epictetus**  
*55-135 AD*

Listening goes beyond verbal communication. Listening to your own body, to your muscles, and making the mind-body connection is one example of listening. Another example is hearing the sounds of nature. Another is watching how people react to what you say.

Listen with two ears in every sense of the word that you can imagine.
