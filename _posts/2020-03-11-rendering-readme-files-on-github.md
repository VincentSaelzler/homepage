I thought that GitHub would only render README.md files on in the root page of the project.

I just noticed that a repo can have multiple README.md files!

I happened to notice it in [Microsoft's repo for Visual Studio Code Development Containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/container-templates).
