Costco was almost exactly like I imaged it. Warehouse looking, low prices, pallets of stuff.

It had some random items for sale I would not have expected. Examples would be kitchen gadgets, flashlights, hoodies, etc. Basically a bunch of impulse-buy type stuff.

I made the trip with my wife, her sister, and my brother-in-law. Thanks to Max and Rachel for letting us join them on their trip!
