Despite the click-bait header, I will not comment on whether the size of a Windows installation is "too" big.

**However, I do have facts!**

I installed Windows 10 version 20H2 on a VM with no internet connection.

Once I was on the home/welcome/desktop screen, the installation used **18.8 GiB**.

After performing Windows updates, and installing VirtIO drivers (to help performance of VM) the total install size was **23.5 GiB**.

These results were logged on 2021-02-07.
