I am not in the same position as hon1nbo, but I feel like their story and mine do have many parallels.

For the past few years, I've physically set up and managed several web servers in my garage.

I am giving them up. Doing my own web hosting was a ton of fun! There was lots to learn, and it was engaging. However, I want to make room for other things in my life.

When I am administering the physical and software configuration of these machines, I am **not** journaling, working out, or connecting with friends.

Therefore, I've migrated this website to a cloud provider.

This is the most recent step in my ongoing quest to spend my limited time in life wisely.
