Today, Jupiter and Saturn formed a visible "double planet" for the [first time in 800 years](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saturn-jupiter-winter-solstice-great-conjunction/). It was also the winter solstice.

**The winter solstice of 2020 was a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the planets align!**

Here is the "double planet" that looks like a single one with the naked eye.

*Jupiter and Saturn are the bright spot toward the top left of the tree.*

With the binoculars, you can see the two planets distinctly. It took two people holding the phone camera and binoculars to make this happen!
