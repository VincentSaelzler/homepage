I've had my 2001 Ford Focus since 2012. It started having trouble lately, at it was time to let it go!

I decided to donate it to the local NPR station, WFAE.

Does this sound like a good idea? Check out more details about [WFAE's Vehicle Donation Program](https://wfae.careasy.org/home)!

What a modern interior. . . for the year 2000

So many hours of work. Kept it running for a solid 8 years!
