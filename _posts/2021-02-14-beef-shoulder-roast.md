Beef shoulder roast and beef chuck roast were on sale at Harris Teeter.

The sticker on the shoulder roast package said "oven roast" and the one on the chuck roast package said "pot roast".

I put the shoulder roast in the oven. It worked out well.

It tastes like the beef that comes in a Chinese restaurant dish. It is relatively tough and relatively lean. Has good strong flavor. Would definitely make again.

It was **delicious** cut up into strips to make a sandwich!
