This was the first time I've snowboarded over a rainbow rail.

It was also the first solo snowboarding trip I've taken. I headed up to Beech Mountain Resort for the weekend.

It was peaceful and relaxing to have just me and the mountain for a few days.

The weather was crisp, cold and beautiful. The trees were coated in ice!

I had to bundle up to stay warm. The magnetic goggles and matching face mask did a **great** job!

I was **super excited** to take the **very last** chair up with the ski patrol. What an amazing end to a great day of boarding!
