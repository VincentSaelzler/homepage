Iâ€™ve never baked a beef rib roast before! Hereâ€™s the story of what happened.

Seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic. Placed on countertop for a few hours. Put into the oven when the roast was 52 degrees.

Baked at 250 degrees for about 3 hours. Once the roast reached 120 degrees, cranked the oven up to high for almost 10 minutes to get a sear.

After searing and removing from the oven, the roast was at around 126 degrees.

The result was pretty good! I was going for medium rare, but ended up at a medium.

For my first-ever attempt: Iâ€™ll take it! ðŸ˜Š

Next time Iâ€™ll endeavor to have it closer to rare. Stay tuned.
